        certificate_mismatch: The certificate does not match with the provided private-key.
        weak_signature_algorithm: This certificate was signed using the weak "{provided}" algorithm. Expected at least algorithm "{expected}".".
        key_bits_too_low: The private-key bits-size {provided} is too low. Expected at least {expected} bits.
        certificate_is_revoked: 'The certificate with serial-number "{serial}" was marked as revoked on { revoked_on, date, short } with reason: ({reason_code}) {reason}.'
        expected_leaf_certificate: The certificate with common-name "{common_name}" contains a CA extension. Expected a leaf certificate.

        unspecified: unspecified (no specific reason was given).
        keyCompromise: the private key associated with the certificate has been compromised.
        cACompromise: the CA's private key is has been compromised and is in the possession of an unauthorized individual. When a CA's private key is revoked, this results in all certificates issued by the CA that are signed using the private key associated with the revoked certificate being considered revoked.
        affiliationChanged: the user has terminated their relationship with the organization indicated in the Distinguished Name attribute of the certificate. This revocation code is typically used when an individual is terminated or has resigned from an organization.
        superseded: a replacement certificate has been issued to a user.
        cessationOfOperation: the CA is decommissioned, no longer to be used.
        privilegeWithdrawn: the certificate (public-key or attribute certificate) was revoked because a privilege contained within that certificate has been withdrawn.
        aACompromise: it is known or suspected that aspects of the AA validated in the attribute certificate have been compromised.
